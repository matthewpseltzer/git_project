        <p class="mono">
            I have been a career software developer for nearly twenty-five years but for quite a while I have had this nagging feeling that there were very important skills missing from my toolbox.
            About twenty years ago, I had an opportunity to learn these skills but I was intimidated by the prospect of doing so.

        <p class="mono">Hunter Business School&apos;s Web Application Design and Development (WADD) program is top-notch--the various tools and methodologies I have learned are invaluable additions to the programming skills I already possess.</p>
